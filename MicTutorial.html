          <strong>Problem:</strong><br>
              How can one effectively teach the complex process of sound recording using microphones, given the challenge posed by the limited accessibility of hands-on experience?

        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br>
        By utilizing 3D scanning tools such as Trinio Plus to scan studio equipment, and AR creation and viewing tools like Adobe Aero, I propose that it is possible to enhance the teaching of Sound Recording Technology. This approach will enable students to interact with virtual studio gear and explore different microphone types and techniques in a more immersive and engaging manner, ultimately improving their understanding and retention of the material.

            <p><strong>Information about the Mics</strong><br>
            <strong>Shure SM57</strong>: <br>The SM57 is a dynamic microphone that is known for its durability and versatility. It is often used to capture the sound of amplified instruments such as electric guitars and drums, as well as vocals in live performances or recording sessions. It has a bright and punchy sound, with a strong midrange presence and a tight low-end.
            <br>
            <strong>Neumann U87</strong>: <br>The U87 is a condenser microphone that is widely considered a studio staple. It is often used to capture vocals, acoustic instruments, and drum overheads. The U87 has a warm and natural sound, with a smooth top-end and a rich midrange. It can provide a detailed and nuanced representation of the source material, with a slightly elevated high-end that adds a sense of air and openness.
            <br>
            <strong>Royer R-121</strong>: <br>The Royer microphone is a ribbon microphone that is prized for its ability to capture the natural tone and character of acoustic instruments such as guitars, strings, and horns. It has a smooth and natural sound, with a warm and detailed midrange and a smooth top-end that rolls off gently. The ribbon design of the Royer microphone also gives it a fast transient response, making it a popular choice for capturing dynamic performances with a natural and musical feel.

          <p><strong>How mic placement can impact recording</strong><br>
            The placement of a microphone in relation to a speaker in an amplifier can have a significant impact on the resulting recording. This is because the position of the microphone relative to the speaker affects the balance of frequencies that are captured and can also influence the overall tone and character of the sound.
            <br>
            When a microphone is placed in the middle of the speaker, it tends to capture a relatively even balance of high, mid, and low frequencies. This is because the speaker cone moves more uniformly in the center, producing a more balanced sound. This placement can be ideal for capturing a full-range sound that is suitable for mixing later on. However, the sound captured can be less exciting or less distinctive than other placement options. 

            <br>
           In contrast, when a microphone is placed off-center or on the side of the speaker, it tends to capture a more focused or emphasized frequency range. This is because the speaker cone moves differently at different points around the edge of the speaker, creating different resonances and frequencies. Placing the mic on the side can emphasize the high-end, while moving the mic towards the edge can emphasize the mid-range. This can be useful for capturing a particular tone or character in a guitar or bass amplifier, for example.
