  <P>Ur all I can think about 24/7 and its killing me. WHen I am sad, I cant deal with it</P>
    <p>it feels like, u don't want to talk to me. </p>
    <p>It feels like u don't know me, u don't ask how I am, or u don't ask to call. I don't feel like I am a priority</p>
    <P>if u were upset, I would try to do everything to make it right, but here I am apologizing for being upset</P>
    <p>it's been 8 mos, my feelings shudnt feel invalid. I am flying from the other side of the world, and driving up 5 hrs. ALl because I want to see u so badly</p>
    <p>I am not gonna tell u not to go, obvi, but like, ahhhhh it feels like u don't care. We could've seen each other in the summer, we could've talked more</p>
    <p>idk. just give me any sign that u want to see me, u don't even compliment me really. like why didn't u call me this morning when u saw i was crying. One day doesn't matter, but i am scared its gonna be like that, and i am not a priority. all i need is some affirmation sometimes. j, pls, try </p>

  <p>TBH, I am nervous. i am trying to not overthink, but u know me. I am scared that i make it all in my head u know.  
    But I am trying not to let that affect me. But it does.</p>
  <p>  I mean, I just don't know how u feel. Like I can't wait to text and call! </p>
    I keep reminding myself, that it's better to wait till the reunion, and that it'll b okay. BUTTT im missing u a lot. But its soon now and that's good:)  
    <p>*if u see these, i would appreciate any sign, anything to make me feel a bit better. But also, i don't wanna ask too much.</p>

    I just hate being unsure. I love you, and I want to show u so badly. But i also want to give u space. i want to call u, but i dont wanna push u.

    <p>I have so much to tell u. It can wait. I just gotta make myself busy. </p>

    <p> I have been writing a lot, music, journal, etc. </p>

    Anyway. Just lmk.

    <p>Weirdly, I feel closer to you, maybe it's cuz I see u so soon.  </p>
    <p>I think a year ago, I thought i was ready to settle, to give up, I am realising </p>
